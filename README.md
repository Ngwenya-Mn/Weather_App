# Project Overview

The Weather App project is designed to utilize an API to fetch weather data and present it in a user-friendly interface. With this app, users can easily obtain weather information for any city they search for. The app fetches data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, and displays it alongside an appropriate weather icon. This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and dynamic web application.
